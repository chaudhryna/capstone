# Capstone Project for CS50 Web

## Overview

The project I created is a Help Desk ticketing system for a small office.  The program allows a user to submit a simple trouble ticket that the IT Support staff receives.  The project is built with Django 4.2, Python 3.11, Bootstrap 5.3, Fontawesome, Crispy-forms, Pillow, Cropper.js, Chart.js, and Postgres SQL 15.  

I built this project because of my experience as a system admin in various companies and organizations.  We would always have different ticketing systems but they were usually so complicated that our customers wouldn't bother to fill them out so we had to fill the tickets out and then work them so that the managers could justify the expense.   

To take care of this I made the ticket super simple to fill out and had a field that the tech could leave notes on any issue that came up in case the ticket needed to be escalated or worked by another tech.
